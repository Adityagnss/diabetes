# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various health metrics and predict the probability of diabetes onset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Prediction:** Provides predictions on new data using the trained model.
- **Visualization:** Visualizes data and prediction results with graphs and charts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Adityagnss/diabetes.git
    cd diabetes
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**
   Ensure your data is in the appropriate format and located in the `data/` directory.

2. **Training the Model**
   Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Making Predictions**
   Use the prediction script with your input data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input your_data.csv
   ```

4. **Visualizations**
   Generate and view visualizations by running:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```
